A **Toronto hospital** required a rapid migration of its on-premises file infrastructure and unstructured data—including file servers and a SharePoint Server 2013 environment—to the cloud. <!--more--> The hospital adopted a **multi-staged transformation strategy**, beginning with a lift-and-shift migration of its SharePoint environment to **SharePoint Online**, taking advantage of the enhanced security, scalability, and integration offered by **Microsoft 365. In parallel**, user home drives hosted on file servers were migrated to OneDrive at scale, while departmental and organizational data was moved to **SharePoint Online**, unlocking modern collaboration features for staff. In the final stage, the legacy SharePoint architecture was modernized through the conversion of classic sites and pages into modern SharePoint experiences using contemporary layouts and web parts.
