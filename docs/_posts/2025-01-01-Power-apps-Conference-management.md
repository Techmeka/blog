One of the operations team from **CCRM** previously managed conference placement and attendance tracking through a heavily manual process involving spreadsheets and email threads. <!--more--> The approach relied on maintaining a master Excel file and coordinating approvals over email—leading to versioning issues, inconsistent data, and delayed responses across departments.

To modernize this workflow, TechMeka developed a fully integrated **Conference Management and Placement system** using Microsoft’s **Power Platform**. The solution replaced manual entry and disconnected approvals with an intelligent, low-code application built entirely on **Microsoft 365** infrastructure.

## Challenges:
- A manually updated “Master Conference List” maintained in Excel created version control risks and lack of audit history.
- Conference approval requests were emailed between stakeholders with no centralized tracking or status visibility.
- The process lacked automation, validation, or any integration with existing Microsoft 365 identity and permission structures.
- Manual reporting and reconciliation efforts slowed down response time and introduced unnecessary overhead for the Attract team.

## Solution – Conference Management System Built with Microsoft Power Platform

TechMeka architected and delivered the entire application using Microsoft 365’s native low-code ecosystem, enabling speed, compliance, and ease of use without requiring external platforms.

### Technology Stack
The conference management app was built using the following Microsoft 365 components:
- **Microsoft SharePoint List**: Hosted the master conference database with custom columns for approvals, attendees, conference types, and metadata.
- **PowerApps**: Served as the front-end interface for submission, review, and approval of conference requests. The app included role-based controls and input validation.
- **Power Automate**: Managed all backend workflows including:
  - Request submission notifications
  - Multi-stage approval routing
  - Status updates and audit logs
- **Azure Active Directory**: Used for user identity, role enforcement, and contextual display logic inside the app.

### Business Workflow Design
- CCRM Operation's team was designated as product owner and data steward, responsible for managing and maintaining the central SharePoint list.
- The workflow supported:
  - New conference request submissions from staff
  - Multiple approval stages (e.g., department lead, finance, executive)
  - Real-time status tracking and confirmation emails
  - Integration with google maps to provide additional context to attendees
- Business logic within Power Automate ensured routing was dynamic and context-aware (e.g., department-based approvers).

## Benefits & Outcomes:
- **Centralized System of Record**: SharePoint now houses a living, structured record of all conferences—queryable and auditable.
- **No More Email Chains**: All approval workflows are automated, timestamped, and traceable through the Power Platform.
- **Faster Request Turnaround**: Automating approvals and notifications dramatically reduced response time.
- **User-Friendly UX**: PowerApps provided an intuitive interface usable across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Scalable & Secure**: Built entirely on Microsoft 365 with no additional licensing or platform risk.
