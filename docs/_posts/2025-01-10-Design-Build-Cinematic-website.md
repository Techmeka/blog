## Challenges:
- Tight timelines for sourcing and provisioning hardware across both user and infrastructure environments.
- No in-house IT personnel, requiring full external support for strategy, execution, and ongoing management.
- Obligation to comply with industry regulations and Raymond James’ data protection standards, despite operating independently.
- Lack of user policies, IT documentation, and defined governance frameworks beyond technical controls.
- No asset management system in place to track or control hardware, software, or licenses.
- No device management solution in place to enforce patching, security policies, and lifecycle oversight of corporate endpoints.
- Complex mailbox and data migration, compounded by limited access and visibility into the incumbent systems.
- Need to implement advanced security and data protection measures to align with regulatory and operational requirements from day one.

## Solution:
To meet the firm’s aggressive timelines and regulatory obligations, TechMeka delivered a comprehensive, end-to-end IT enablement and transition program:
- Rapid Hardware Procurement & Autopilot Deployment: Leveraged vendor partnerships to quickly source devices and implemented Microsoft Intune Autopilot to streamline deployment, enabling employees to receive fully configured and secured hardware out of the box—at scale and with minimal IT overhead.
- Fully Managed IT Services: Delivered outsourced IT leadership and operational support, covering infrastructure strategy, execution, and day-to-day management in the absence of in-house IT personnel.
- Regulatory & Compliance Alignment: Implemented security and governance controls aligned with industry regulations and Raymond James’ data protection standards, ensuring compliance from day one.
- Policy & Documentation Development: Authored comprehensive IT policies, user onboarding guides, and operational SOPs to establish governance, accountability, and user readiness.
- Asset Management & RMM Integration: Deployed an automated asset management system alongside a remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform to track hardware/software inventory, enforce compliance, and enable proactive support.
- Device Management & Security Enforcement: Rolled out Microsoft Intune for centralized endpoint management—enforcing patching, device compliance, encryption, and access policies across the organization.
- Secure Mailbox & Data Migration: Designed and executed a secure, phased migration strategy tailored to complex mailbox environments with limited visibility into source systems.
- Enterprise-Grade Security Controls: Enabled data loss prevention (DLP), multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access, and sensitivity labels to provide robust security, governance, and compliance coverage.
